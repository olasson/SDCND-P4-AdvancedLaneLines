*This is a revised version of my Advanced Lane Lines project.*

## Project overview

The majority of the project code is located in the folder `code`:

* [`_centroids.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/_centroids.py)
* [`_draw.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/_draw.py)
* [`_error.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/_error.py)
* [`_math.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/_math.py)
* [`_process.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/code/_process.py)
* [`calibration.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/calibration.py)
* [`detect.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/detect.py)
* [`io.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/io.py)
* [`misc.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/misc.py)
* [`plots.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/code/plots.py)

The main project script is called [`advanced_lane_lines.py`](https://github.com/olasson/SDCND-T1-P4-AdvancedLaneLines/blob/master/advanced_lane_lines.py). It contains the implementation of a very simple command line tool.

The images shown in this readme are found in 

* `images/`

The videos of the pipeline result is found in

* `videos/result/`

## Command line arguments

All arguments are technically optional. The program also checks for "illegal" argument combinations to an extent.

See the main script linked above for a detailed list of supported arguments and their function. I will make an effort to specify which commands were used for different parts of the project.

## Camera Calibration
